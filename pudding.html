    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chocolate pudding from a box just doesn’t measure up to its homemade
      counterpart! If you’ve always wanted to make homemade pudding from
      scratch, we have you covered with this quick and easy recipe.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 cups whole milk, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon chocolate extract (or vanilla extract)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To start, place two egg yolks into a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk the egg yolks vigorously for about 60 seconds, until the yolks
        lighten in color and thicken to a frothy, foamy texture.
      </li>
      <li>Add cornstarch and some milk to the egg yolks.</li>
      <li>Whisk until fully combined, then set aside.</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan, combine sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and milk.</li>
      <li>
        Heat this mixture to a scalding temperature, then whisk it into the egg
        cornstarch mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour everything back into the saucepan and cook over high heat until the
        pudding thickens into a luscious, silky consistency. Then remove the
        pudding from the heat and stir in chocolate or vanilla extract for extra
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the chocolate pudding into a big bowl to chill.</li>
      <li>
        Then I press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding, so a
        skin doesn’t form. Pudding skin gives me the heebie jeebies, and no one
        wants the heebie jeebies, right?
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill the pudding for an hour or two in the refrigerator, then give the
        pudding a stir and serve. Enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
